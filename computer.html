            <p>
                My name is Gabriel Reader and I am 13 years and in 8th Grade. I was born in San Francisco but have been
                growing up in Oakland my whole life. My favorite sports are swimming and tennis and I like to write, 
                draw, skate and watch movies in my free time. Right now I am in a really fun Summer Coding Camp called 
                <a href="https://www.hiddengeniusproject.org/" style="color: rgb(255, 217, 0);">The Hidden Genius Project </a>where I learn a lot of new things about technology development, software and coding. 
                One thing that I happen to be learning about right now is Building a Website. This site happens to be my FIRST ONE! 
                so I just want to use it to talk a bit about myself, things I like, and what I want to do in my future. Hope you like it!
            </p>
