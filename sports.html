            <h2>MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND BOOKS!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since I was young I played soccer, swimming and tennis but just about a few years 
                ago I had to stop playing soccer because I was too busy during the week and because
                it became hard trying to juggle all those weekly and extra-curricular activities in 
                my schedule. I still really like being on a Swim Team and playing Tennis though, 
                from Monday through Friday I have Swim Practice and I have Tennis Practice on the Weekends. 
                Unfortunately, I am no longer able to play Tennis Right now because of the on-going pandemic, 
                but Iâ€™m sure that once it is over I will be able to play.
