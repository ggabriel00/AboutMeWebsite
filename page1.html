            <h2>MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND BOOKS!</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many different movies, including TV shows, that I like which are most 
                of the Star Wars movies, Stranger Things, the Office, and most of the Marvel and 
                DC movies. At the beginning of 2020 I started getting into anime and some shows that 
                I got into were Hunter/Hunter, Attack on Titans and Saiki K, One Punch Man
                and the Seven Deadly Sins. Most of the books that I like are Action packed like Ready Player One, 
                which is about a Earth far in the future where everybody lives in a Virtual-Reality Universe.
